# Cross-Compilation

This section demonstrates how to configure and execute cross-compilation for Scala Native projects using Bazel. It covers building binaries for different hardware architectures and operating systems from a single host machine.

## Examples

- **[01-cross-compile-hello-world](01-cross-compile-hello-world)**:
  Cross-compiling a basic Scala Native application for various platforms using a hermetic LLVM toolchain.
