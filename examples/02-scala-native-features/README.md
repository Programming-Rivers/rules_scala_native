# Scala Native Features

This section explores features that allow you to write code that is closer to the "metal" and can be more performant than standard Scala code, without requiring you to write code in C or other "system" languages.

## Examples

- **[01-zone-allocator](01-zone-allocator)**: Efficient memory management using semantically scoped blocks.
- **[02-pointers](02-pointers)**: Low-level memory access and pointer arithmetic.
- **[03-c-structs](03-c-structs)**: Defining and using C-style data structures.
- **[04-posix-bindings](04-posix-bindings)**: Direct interaction with the operating system services.
- **[05-intrinsics](05-intrinsics)**: Accessing compiler-specific optimizations and CPU features.
