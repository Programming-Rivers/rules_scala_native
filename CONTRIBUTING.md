# Contributing to rules_scala_native

Thank you for your interest in the `rules_scala_native` project!
We appreciate your enthusiasm for building Bazel support for Scala Native.

## Project Status and Vision

`rules_scala_native` is currently in its early stages of development.
It originated as a passion project and is still evolving.
Our primary goal is to provide a high-quality, reliable, and idiomatic Bazel ruleset for the Scala Native ecosystem.

Because the project is still forming its core architecture and long-term roadmap,
we are taking a cautious approach to community contributions to ensure the project's stability and health.

## Contribution Policy

At this time, is open to use,
but **the project is closed to external code contributions (Pull Requests).**

We have made this decision for several key reasons:

1.  **Governance Model:**
    We are currently defining a sustainable governance and maintenance model.
    We believe it is essential to have this foundation in place before opening the codebase to wider participation.
2.  **Architectural Stability:**
    The project is in a Proof of Concept phase with many changes expected in the core APIs and internal abstractions.
    Limiting contributions at this stage allows us to explore and discover the best design.
3.  **Contributor Vetting:**
    To ensure the long-term health of the project and the community,
    we intend to implement a vetting process for contributors.
    The goal of the vetting process is:
    - Ensure that every contributor has a deep understanding of the project's goals and technical standards.
    - Decide how to handle the increasing amount of AI-generated contributions such as code and documentation.
    - Prevent incident such as [XZ backdoor attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_backdoor).

## How You Can Help

While we are not accepting code contributions just yet,
your participation is extremely valuable to discuss the governance model for the project.

Here is how you can support the project today:
*   **Join the Discussion:**
    Consider starting or joining a thread in the [Discussions](https://github.com/Programming-Rivers/rules_scala_native/discussions) section to ask questions, share your experiences, or suggest architectural refinements, particularly around the following topics:
    - Governance model
    - Contribution guidelines

## Future Roadmap

We are committed to evolving `rules_scala_native` into a community-driven project.
Setting up a formal governance model and opening a path for vetted contributors is a priority on our roadmap.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we build the foundation for a healthy open-source project.
